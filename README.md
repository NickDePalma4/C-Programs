# C Programs

This directory contains several system programming projects implemented in C. Each project focuses on different aspects of system programming and includes detailed README files within their respective directories. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## Simple Shell

The Simple Shell project involves implementing a command line interpreter or shell. The shell operates by creating a child process to execute user commands and displays a prompt for more user input after each command. Refer to the `simple-shell/README.md` file for more information.

## Hash Tree

The Hash Tree project involves implementing a hash tree data structure. The hash tree provides an efficient way to store and retrieve key-value pairs using a hash-based indexing mechanism. Refer to the `hash-tree/README.md` file for more information.

## Database Server and Client

The Database Server and Client project involves implementing a multi-threaded server and interactive client applications that communicate using sockets. The server handles client requests, while the client can perform operations such as putting and getting records from the database. Refer to the `server/README.md` file for more information.

Please navigate to each project's respective directory for detailed instructions, explanations, and code.
